\chapter{Model Training}
\section{Introduction}

In this chapter, we delve into the details of the model training process. Model training is a crucial step in our machine learning pipeline, where we build, fine-tune, and optimize machine learning models to make accurate predictions based on our dataset. This chapter provides an overview of the methodologies, tools, and techniques employed to create predictive models.

We begin this chapter by discussing the dataset and its preprocessing. Clean, well-structured data is the foundation of successful model training. Next, we explore the choice of algorithms and techniques suitable for our problem domain. We'll cover the training process, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics, ensuring our models perform optimally.

Throughout this chapter, we'll illustrate the practical aspects of model training with best practices. Whether you're new to machine learning or a seasoned data scientist, this chapter will provide valuable insights into our approach to building robust predictive models from softsensor data.

Let's dive into the fascinating world of model training and discover how it empowers our data-driven solutions.

\section{Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)}

In this section, we conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the characteristics of the sensor data. We initially visualized the sensor time series, revealing significant variations among different sensors. Notably, each sensor exhibited distinct patterns, with some displaying considerable noise, while others showed more stable trends.

\subsection{Sensor Time Series Plots}

We present two representative sensor time series plots to illustrate the observed variations:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sensor_noisy_plot.png}
        \caption{Sensor with High Noise and Constant Increase}
        \label{fig:sensor_noisy}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sensor_stable_plot.png}
        \caption{Sensor with Low Noise and Frequent Jumps}
        \label{fig:sensor_stable}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Sensor Time Series Plots}
\end{figure}

As depicted in Figure \ref{fig:sensor_noisy}, Sensor 1 exhibits substantial noise and a constant upward trend, while Figure \ref{fig:sensor_stable} illustrates Sensor 2 with lower noise but frequent jumps in values.

\subsection{Correlation analysis}
Given the diverse nature of the sensor data, we decided to extract the mean from each sensor's time series. This aggregation aimed to capture the central tendency and simplify the subsequent analysis.

We computed the correlation matrix based on the mean values extracted from the sensors. Surprisingly, the correlation was low, suggesting a complex relationship among the features. The intricate nature of this relationship could potentially be captured by more sophisticated models, such as Random Forest or other tree-based models.

Below is the correlation matrix representing the relationships between different sensors:
\newpage
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{correlation_matrix.png}
    \caption{Correlation Matrix of Sensor Data}
    \label{fig:correlation_matrix}
\end{figure}

This correlation matrix provides insights into the linear relationships between different sensors. However, the low correlation values indicate that more intricate patterns might exist.

Considering the complexity observed in the correlation analysis, further exploration with advanced machine learning models, such as Random Forest, could potentially unveil hidden relationships within the data.


\section{Feature Engineering}
Examining the correlation matrix in Figure \ref{fig:correlation_matrix}, a notable observation is the high correlation between surface tension and both anionic and nonionic surfactants. However, certain rows displayed NaN values, prompting the application of the MICE algorithm. MICE, an acronym for Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations, is an algorithm designed to predict missing data by leveraging the information from other available features. This method aims to fill in the gaps in the dataset, contributing to a more comprehensive and accurate analysis.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{MICE_convergence.png}
        \caption{MICE Convergence: nonionic surfactants (top), anionic surfactants (bottom)}
        \label{fig:MICE_convergence}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{MICE_distributions.png}
        \caption{MICE Imputation Distribution: nonionic surfactants (top), anionic surfactants (bottom). Red line represents original data distribution, and the black line represents imputed data distribution}
        \label{fig:MICE_distribution}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{MICE Algorithm Results}
\end{figure}

Because the data was noisy, we considered using filter smoothing to reduce the noise in the time series. After attempting this approach, we found that it didn't provide significant benefits, so we decided to proceed without it. Below are the plots illustrating how the smoothing appeared:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sensor_noisy_plot.png}
        \caption{Raw Signal}
        \label{fig:smoothing_a}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{smoothing.png}
        \caption{Smoothed Signal}
        \label{fig:smoothing_b}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Effect of Smoothing on Time Series}
\end{figure}

We employed a systematic approach to extract relevant information from our time series data. Our initial feature set consisted of mean, standard deviation, 25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile statistics from each time series feature. We believed that capturing these central tendencies and spread characteristics would provide valuable insights into the data.

Additionally, we experimented with augmenting these basic statistics by considering autocorrelation, trend statistics, and standard deviation differences. Although the latter seemed promising, it did not yield substantial improvements in our results.


To gain further insights into feature importance, we conducted feature importance plots, which highlighted that certain sensors had limited relevance for the model's performance.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{feature_importance_plot.png}
    \caption{Feature Importance Plot for Random Forest}
    \label{fig:feature_importance_plot}
\end{figure}

In response, we conducted experiments using different subsets of sensors. First, we tested the model with only the most important sensors (conductivity, CODeq, turbidity), which resulted in similar performance to the full sensor set. Subsequently, we experimented with using only the least expensive sensors (turbidity, pressure, flow, pH, conductivity), which showed slightly worse results, with a mean absolute error (MAE) increase of less than 0,5. However, this approach significantly reduced costs. 

In comparison, initial experiment with all sensors (abs210, abs360, abs254, BODeq, CODeq, alkalinity, conductivity, pH, flow, pressure, turbidity) would cost us approximately 12,800 euros for sensors only. The experiment with most important sensors would lower it down to 8,800 euros. With the cheapest sensors approach, we would spend only 4,600 euros, which is almost three times less expensive then our initial experiment, and is almost twice less expensive then our most important sensors experiment. 

In the end, we decided to proceed with using the least expensive sensors, along with the essential statistical features we initially extracted: mean, standard deviation, 25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile. While we would have liked to explore more sophisticated modeling techniques, the limitation of available data prevented us from delving into deep learning or complex time series models.

This pragmatic approach allowed us to maintain good model performance with MAE score of 3.879 for surface tension while optimizing cost-effectiveness, aligning with our goal of leveraging machine learning for practical and efficient solutions.

\begin{table}[h]

    \label{tab:ml_results}
    \begin{tabular}{lcccc}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Sensor Setup} & \textbf{ST MAE} & \textbf{NS MAE} & \textbf{AS MAE} & \textbf{Sensor Cost (\$)} \\

        Most important & \textbf{3.558} & 67.2 & 20.82 & 8800 \\
        Cheapest & 3.879 & 64.36 & 23.38 & \textbf{4,600} \\

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Machine Learning Results and Associated Costs for Various Sensor Setups. MAE: Mean Absolute Error. ST: Surface Tension, NS: Nonionic Surfactants, AS: Anionic Surfactants.}
\end{table}

\section{Training and Tuning}
In our training and tuning process, we adopted a well-thought-out strategy to ensure robust model performance. To begin with, we employed stratified cross-validation with 5 splits, while also reserving a separate test set for final model evaluation. The stratification was conducted across the washing and rinsing labels to guarantee an even representation of both in our validation sets. This approach aimed to mitigate any bias that could arise from imbalanced data distribution.

For hyperparameter tuning, we leveraged the TPEsampler with 100 optimization attempts. This method allowed us to explore a range of hyperparameters efficiently. We based our selection of hyperparameters on the average mean absolute error (MAE) across three scaled labels (surface tension, anionic surfactants, and nonionic surfactants) and five cross-validation splits. We employed two tree-based models for our experiments: the XGBoost Regressor and Random Forest. These models were chosen because the relationships within the data were complex and non-linear, making tree-based models well-suited to capture these nuances.

Ultimately, we decided to ensemble these two models using an averaging technique. We found that the Random Forest model exhibited slightly better accuracy and was assigned a weight of approximately 0.51 in the ensemble, while the XGBoost Regressor, although slightly less accurate, was still valuable and received a weight of around 0.49. This ensemble approach proved to be effective, as the combination of the two models demonstrated better generalization performance than either model individually.

Our approach to training and tuning focused on the practicality of implementing tree-based models, considering the complex and nonlinear nature of the relationships in the data. The ensemble technique further improved our model's overall performance, aligning with our goal of delivering practical and accurate solutions.

Throughout our training and tuning process, we logged all relevant metrics in MLflow, ensuring transparency and easy monitoring of model performance. Additionally, we registered our models, allowing for reproducibility and easy deployment in practical applications. This approach aligns with our goal of practicality and efficiency in the field of machine learning and MLOps.

\section{Retraining}
For the purpose of retraining the model, we've established a retraining pipeline. This pipeline allows you to specify the model's configuration using a data class within a script. By simply running this script, you can train the model with the predefined configuration. 

One of the significant advantages of this approach is its efficiency. Since the hyperparameters are already set in the configuration, there's no need for time-consuming hyperparameter tuning. This makes it an ideal choice when you need to quickly retrain the model or reproduce a specific experiment.

This retraining pipeline offers a practical and convenient solution for maintaining and updating your models, aligning with your goal of achieving quick and efficient results.

\chapter{Deployment}

Our deployment strategy is a critical component of our Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) process. In this chapter, we'll delve into our deployment pipeline and its two core sections, showcasing the tools and techniques we've employed to ensure seamless and efficient model deployment.

\section{AWS Deployment with Docker Containers}

When it comes to deploying our machine learning models, we've chosen Amazon Web Services (AWS) as our cloud service provider. AWS, being one of the largest and most renowned cloud service providers, offers the robust infrastructure and services needed for our deployment pipeline.

We've adopted a containerization approach using Docker to package our models and their dependencies. Our deployment pipeline consists of two Docker containers, each serving a specific purpose in the workflow. These containers are pushed to the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) as part of our automated deployment process.

To illustrate our deployment pipeline visually, please refer to the provided image showcasing the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) setup. This visual aid outlines the sequence of events in our deployment process, from code changes to production-ready containers.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Deployment_process.png}
\caption{Deployment Process Diagram}
\label{fig:system-architecture}
\end{figure}

Our CI/CD pipeline is powered by GitHub Actions, which orchestrates the entire deployment process. Inside GitHub Actions, we perform various tasks, including automated testing, linting to ensure code quality, and model retrieval from MLflow. Only models marked as "Production" are included in the deployment pipeline. Subsequently, we push two container images with different tags to a single ECR repository.

\section{Deployment Pipelines for Prediction and Monitoring}

In the context of our deployment strategy, we have two distinct deployment pipelines, each serving a unique function.

The first pipeline, known as the "Prediction Pipeline" is dedicated to generating predictions through the utilization of our machine learning models. Its primary function involves retrieving relevant data from the PostgreSQL database hosted on the AWS Relational Database Service (RDS). Once the data is acquired, the pipeline seamlessly executes our models, leveraging their analytical capabilities. Subsequently, the computed predictions are then deposited into a designated table within the same database. This pipeline ensures that our models are actively providing predictions for real-world data, enabling us to leverage the power of machine learning in practical applications.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{prediction_pipeline.png}
    \caption{Prediction Pipeline and Database Tables Interactions}
    \label{fig:prediction_pipeline}
\end{figure}


The second pipeline, termed the "Monitoring Pipeline," plays a crucial role in data quality and drift monitoring. This pipeline relies on the table containing predictions and training data, that would be pulled from DVC, to monitor incoming data and identify potential drift or anomalies. When drift is detected, the monitoring pipeline generates clear and detailed reports. These reports are then sent via email to relevant stakeholders, allowing for prompt action and maintenance of model accuracy. It utilizes 90\% of the data, ensuring that the remaining 10\% remains unaltered in case it was recently predicted by the prediction pipeline and has not undergone inspection.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{monitoring_pipeline.png}
    \caption{Monitoring Pipeline and Database Tables Interactions}
    \label{fig:monitoring_pipeline}
\end{figure}

Our deployment strategy is designed for efficiency, reliability, and real-time adaptability, ensuring that our machine learning models are not only accurate but also robust in real-world scenarios. By dividing our deployment into these two dedicated pipelines, we can address both prediction and data quality monitoring, meeting our goal of providing practical and valuable solutions in the field of machine learning and MLOps.


\chapter{Testing Overview}

Testing is a fundamental aspect of ensuring the reliability and functionality of our machine learning models and deployment pipelines. In this chapter, we provide an overview of our testing strategies, encompassing both unit tests and integration tests. We also highlight the use of synthetic data and separate database tables for testing purposes.

\section{Unit Tests}

Unit tests are a crucial component of our testing strategy. They serve the purpose of verifying the correctness and functionality of individual components within our software ecosystem. Our unit tests are designed to check the behavior of specific functions, modules, or classes in isolation, ensuring that each piece of code operates as expected.

These unit tests are executed within our Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, specifically in GitHub Actions. The results of these tests provide us with valuable feedback on the health of our software components. Any unexpected behavior or errors are promptly identified, allowing for rapid resolution.

To facilitate our unit testing process, we have created synthetic data sets that are used as inputs.

\section{Integration Tests}

In addition to unit tests, we conduct integration tests to evaluate the interactions and compatibility of our entire pipeline. Integration tests assess how different components work together as a whole and ensure that data flows smoothly from end to end.

Our integration tests are also orchestrated within GitHub Actions, providing a holistic assessment of the entire deployment process. These tests involve the utilization of synthetic data and separate tables within the Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) created explicitly for testing purposes.

These dedicated testing tables enable us to simulate real-world scenarios and assess the robustness of our deployment pipeline. By running integration tests, we can identify any inconsistencies, bottlenecks, or issues in the flow of data and predictions, guaranteeing that our deployment remains reliable and stable.

Our approach to testing, which includes both unit tests and integration tests, plays a pivotal role in ensuring the functionality and reliability of our machine learning solution. The use of synthetic data and dedicated testing tables enhances our ability to capture and resolve issues, ultimately contributing to the quality and effectiveness of our software ecosystem.

\chapter{Possible Use Cases}
\section{Textile Industry}
The textile manufacturing industry and industrial laundering services utilize a high number of detergents for dyeing, washing, and rinsing processes. Often these processes are linked to inefficiency in resource management and failures in process quality. Particularly, the prediction of surface tension and concentration of surfactants can be used for automatization of the rinsing process in both industries. The sensor array that measures the time series will be integrated via bypass in the rinsing process. If some threshold values of surface tension, i.e. organic contaminants, are exceeded, the rinsing process may be prolonged or more water is added to the rinsing process. Thus, automatically is ensured that the fabrics are free of organic contaminants at the end of manufacturing/textile cleaning process. This ML application will lead do decrease in rewash rate, process failures, fabric replacement and subsequently save resources. The amortization time of such system is expected to be 1 to 3 years.
\section{Parts Cleaning Industry (Automotive Suppliers)}
Industrial parts cleaning is an important industrial branch that uses different solventâsurfactant mixtures to remove contaminants, like grease, from surface of metallic parts. In this way, subsequent processes like assembling of metallic parts can be realized without failures. Here so-called cleaning bathes are used, and the process water is circulated through filtration devices. To ensure the concentration of surfactant solution in the cleaning bath and subsequent rinsing processes, efficient sensor systems are necessary, which not exist in the moment. The cost-efficient sensor array could be easily installed in different cleaning steps and the ML application would derive data, predict surface tension and concentration of surfactants. Based on the monitoring, an efficient controlling algorithm could be set up. The novel technology would lead to faster and more cost-efficient process workflow, as well as ensure that minimum of resources are utilized for the processes.

\chapter{General Description}
\section{Product Perspective}
The project's primary focus is to develop a predictive model for surface tension. Predicting surface tension holds significant importance due to its essential role in the textile manufacturing industry. Surface tension affects various processes like dyeing, finishing, printing, and coating, which are integral to producing high-quality fabrics and materials. Accurate predictions can lead to improved product outcomes, reduced costs, and enhanced overall efficiency in the textile production process.

\section{Tools Used}

In our project, we rely on a variety of tools to effectively manage and enhance our work. These tools play a crucial role in enabling collaboration, version control, automation, and efficient project management.

\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\cdot$] \textbf{Jira:} Jira is our project management tool that helps us track tasks, assign responsibilities, and maintain a clear overview of our project's progress. It ensures that everyone is on the same page and working towards our common goal.
    
    \item[$\cdot$] \textbf{MLFlow:} MLFlow assists us in managing our machine learning models. It enables us to track different model versions, monitor their performance, and store associated artifacts. This allows us to make informed decisions when choosing which model to deploy.

\section{Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\cdot$] \textbf{Data Availability}: We assume that the required input data will be available in the expected format and structure. Any changes or variations in data schema may require adjustments in the data preprocessing and modeling stages.
    
    \item[$\cdot$] \textbf{Stable Environment}: We assume that the deployment environment, including infrastructure and dependencies, will remain stable during the project's deployment and operation. Any changes to the environment might impact the system's performance and behavior.
        
    \item[$\cdot$] \textbf{Representative Training Data}: We assume that the training data used for model development accurately represents real-world scenarios. Any biases or limitations in the training data might affect the model's generalization and predictions.
        
    \item[$\cdot$] \textbf{Stable Model Assumptions}: We assume that the underlying assumptions of the chosen machine learning models hold true within the context of our problem. Deviations from these assumptions might lead to suboptimal or unpredictable results.
        
    \item[$\cdot$] \textbf{Limited Scope of Features}: We assume that the features used for model training and prediction are relevant and encompass the most important aspects of the problem. Features not considered might impact the model's performance.
        
    \item[$\cdot$] \textbf{Monitoring and Maintenance}: We assume that regular monitoring and maintenance of the deployed models will be conducted to ensure their continued effectiveness. Any neglect in monitoring might lead to model degradation.
        
    \item[$\cdot$] \textbf{User Interaction}: We assume that user interactions with the deployed system will follow expected patterns. Unexpected user behavior might necessitate adjustments in user interfaces or feedback mechanisms.
        
    \item[$\cdot$] \textbf{Resource Availability}: We assume that the required computational resources, such as memory, processing power, and storage, will be available for model training, deployment, and monitoring.

Intelligentes Monitoringsystem zur Steigerung der Prozessqualität und Ressourceneffizienz in gewerblichen Wäschereien.

This project is dedicated to advancing the field of surface tension prediction. Using machine learning techniques, our aim is to develop precise models that forecast surface tension values accurately along with nonionic and anionic surfactants. Whether you're delving into the intricacies of surface tension or seeking predictions for various surfactants, this project offers a valuable resource for exploring and analyzing these chemical processes. Join us in unlocking the secrets of surface tension prediction and enhancing our understanding of essential chemical phenomena.

# IMPRESS

Intelligentes Monitoringsystem zur Steigerung der Prozessqualität und Ressourceneffizienz in gewerblichen Wäschereien.

This project is dedicated to predicting surface tension, with a focus on anionic and nonionic surfactants. Leveraging machine learning techniques, our goal is to develop models that accurately forecast surface tension values based on the properties of these surfactants. Whether you're interested in understanding the behavior of anionic or nonionic surfactants or seeking predictions for surface tension, this project provides a valuable resource for exploring and analyzing these chemical processes.
